                    Abstract
                </h2>
                <p>
                The report focuses on improving the design of a STS-crane. This is done by devising 3 different
                concepts of booms, trolleys and hoisting mechanisms. These concept sketches also include the
                position of the hoisting mechanism.<br>
                Secondly, the functionality concept was chosen as final design and functioned as starting posi-
                tion for further improvement and detailing. The design was further analyzed and designed with
                according calculations and tables. The design was dimensioned and detailed sketches were made
                in Solid Works, which were all added to the appendix.
                The third step was to assign materials to the different parts of the crane.
                For this part first a list of all the important properties that had to be taken into account for all
                the parts was made. In every part some different properties were taken into account this is based
                on the importance of the properties of that part. For example in some parts weldability was
                very important because a welding connection has to be used. Although also properties like yield
                strength, cold forming, low density, corrosion and the Poisson ratio were taken into account to
                find out which material is the best to use. With the chosen properties the best materials could
                be found using the CES-edupack program and articles about materials that are all ready used
                nowadays in part for an STS-crane.<br>
                Now that all the materials are known the more detailed parts could be worked out. Also for this
                part firstly a list of properties was made to find out which properties are important for the parts.
                Knowing all the properties a choice for the type of motor, driving system and gearbox can be
                made. With the material type that is used for the frame and boom known, FEM calculations
                were done using the poison rate, density and youngâ€™s modulus of the chosen HSLA steel: ASTM
                A656. With the FEM program calculation as stresses, inertia, displacements and weight were
                calculated. The design chosen showed that it was capable of sustaining its form under a load of
                100 tons.<br>
                Than some machine element calculations of a weld, bolt, key and shaft had to be made to
                calculate especially the thickness at which the parts can handle the applied stress on it. With
                this information a detailed design was made in which the known dimensions are displayed.
                Finally the chosen system to transfer power and torque through the motor to the drum that
                collects the cable is gears. There are two motors and one gearbox. The gearbox includes 2 bevel
                gears, one is connected to the motors shaft and the other is connected to the drums shaft. The
                chosen motor is the simotics SD motor with efficiency class IE3/premium and IC411-totally-
                enclosed fan-cooled, because this motor satisfy the most properties that have to be taken into
                account.<br>
                After the final concept there were still some things that could be optimized in the redesign.
